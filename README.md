# AR Climate Spiral

![AppIcon]()

A minimal iOS AR app that visualizes monthly global temperature anomalies between 
the years 1880 and 2021.
The "climate spiral" is a visualization designed by climate scientist Ed Hawkins 
from the National Centre for Atmospheric Science, University of Reading.

The app visualizes the climate data in AR (Augmented Reality).
The 3DCG are generated at runtime using RealityKit2 Procedural Geometry feature.

- Development Tool: Xcode 13.3
- Target: iOS / iPadOS 15.0 and later
- Frameworks: SwiftUI, ARKit, RealityKit2

In iOS 15.0 and later, you can generate 3D meshes and materials using RealityKit2 
Procedural Geometry Features.
This project shows a sample code that generates triangle meshes and PBR materials 
according to the climate data.

Since the project is a minimal implementation, please modify it as you like.
